Use this API endpoint to retrieve all available bookable slots for a user or team event type within a specified date and time range. This can be particularly useful when you need to check availability for scheduling purposes. For instance, call this API when a user wants to book an appointment or when you need to display all possible time slots for an event. The required parameters are startTime and endTime, we also need either an eventTypeId or a combination of usernameList and/or an eventTypeSlug, the rest are all optional.
